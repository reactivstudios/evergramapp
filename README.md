# Evergram - scroll through all your Telegram channels in one timeline!

Evergram is an android app that shows you a timeline of all messages from your channels on Telegram, so you don't have to go into each channel one by one and view the latest messages.

**Evergram app is not affiliated with Telegram in any way. You must have a Telegram account to use the app.**

Evergram uses Telegram's open-source Tdlib library. It is currently in beta testing and has a long road map of features to implement. Use the [Issues](https://github.com/reactivstudios/evergramapp/issues) tab to report bugs, request features and discuss ideas. There is no guarantee that any requests or ideas will be implemented.
